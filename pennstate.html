<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i><b> What did I do here?</b> </p>
<p>
  I was an International Student sponsored by the Brazilian Government to study abroad. 
  As part of my program I had to either do research at a university or work for an American company. I had the outstading opportunitty to do research at Penn State University, specifically being part of Professor John Carrolls' team. We will be developing during the Summer of 2015 one mobile app. The main focus of the research is the <a href="http://humancomputation.com/ci2014/papers/Demo_Active%20Papers%5CPaper%2041.pdf">Timebanking concept which uses time as a form of currency to encourage service exchanges among timebank members in the same community. </p>
